## 🧩 Feature Breakdown

This section outlines the key features implemented in the Airbnb Clone backend and how each contributes to the overall functionality of the platform.

### 🔐 User Management
Handles user registration, authentication, and profile management. It allows users to securely create accounts, log in, and manage their profile data, ensuring only authorized access to protected features.

### 🏡 Property Management
Enables hosts to create, update, view, and delete property listings. This feature ensures that properties can be listed with accurate details, which are visible and searchable by potential guests.

### 📅 Booking System
Allows users to book available properties by selecting check-in and check-out dates. It manages booking conflicts, reservation status, and stores all relevant booking data for future reference.

### 💳 Payment Processing
Facilitates secure transactions for property bookings. It ensures that payment details are processed and recorded correctly, providing both users and hosts with a reliable transaction history.

### ⭐ Review System
Allows guests to leave reviews and ratings for properties they have stayed in. This feedback system helps future users make informed decisions and encourages hosts to maintain high-quality listings.

### 🚀 API Documentation
Includes REST and GraphQL APIs documented using the OpenAPI standard. It provides clear, structured endpoints and schemas to ease integration for frontend developers and third-party clients.

### ⚡ Database Optimization
Uses techniques such as indexing and caching to improve data retrieval speed and overall performance. This ensures a smooth and scalable user experience as the application grows.


## 🔐 API Security

Securing the backend APIs is critical to protecting sensitive data, maintaining system integrity, and ensuring a safe user experience. The following key security measures will be implemented in the Airbnb Clone backend:

### 🔑 Authentication
All API endpoints will require user authentication using secure token-based methods such as JWT (JSON Web Tokens). This ensures that only registered users can access protected resources, safeguarding user accounts from unauthorized access.

### 🛡️ Authorization
Role-based access control (RBAC) will be used to ensure that users can only perform actions permitted by their role (e.g., only hosts can manage listings). This prevents users from accessing or modifying resources they shouldn't have permission to.

### 🚫 Rate Limiting
Rate limiting will be applied to restrict the number of requests a user or IP address can make within a certain timeframe. This protects the API from abuse, denial-of-service (DoS) attacks, and brute-force attempts.

### 🔒 Data Encryption
Sensitive data such as passwords will be hashed using strong algorithms (e.g., bcrypt), and HTTPS will be enforced for all communication between clients and the server. This ensures user data, including login credentials and payment information, remains secure in transit and at rest.

### 🧪 Input Validation & Sanitization
All incoming requests will be validated and sanitized to prevent injection attacks such as SQL injection or cross-site scripting (XSS). This helps maintain the integrity and security of the backend system.

### 🧾 Secure Payment Handling
Payments will be processed through a trusted third-party payment gateway, ensuring that transaction data is handled securely and compliant with industry standards (e.g., PCI-DSS).

By implementing these security measures, the project aims to protect user data, maintain trust, and ensure compliance with best practices in backend development.
